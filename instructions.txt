Extract the tar, note the location of the /linux64 directory in the extracted
gurobi810 folder, that's Your GUROBI_HOME dir. Then add this to .bashrc

export GUROBI_HOME="/home/tryahrd/grbi/gurobi810/linux64"
export PATH="${PATH}:${GUROBI_HOME}/bin"
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}:${GUROBI_HOME}/lib"

then establish a connection to a college network via whatever vpn
(the one in the .sh sets up for ethz for ubuntu 16), run grbgetkey
from the license file, and then cd to home and look for setup.py
setup.py build is the command, and You should be done.
